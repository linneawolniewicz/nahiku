# Nāhiku
Nāhiku is the ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi word for the 'Big Dipper' constellation.  

This is an open-source package to simplify the task of detecting anomalies in stellar light curves with a principled, probabilistic approach to light curve modeling and anomaly detection. Specifically, this package was developed for the use of detecting dipper anomalies, such as exocomets, in light curves.
